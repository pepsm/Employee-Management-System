### Employee Management System [![Active](http://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-green.svg)](https://tterb.github.io) 

This project is part of the second-semester assignment at Fontys UAS. <b>The Employee Management System</b> consists of Desktop version for the administration and  Web client-side written with vanilla PHP.

Both applications have role separation functionality and validation. The Desktop version is three-layer structured, design using <b>SOLID</b> principles. There are three base user roles - Administrator, Manager, Employee. The system can help employees/employers to easily manage their working shifts and can improve their correspondence, which directly effects the company's overall productivity.
